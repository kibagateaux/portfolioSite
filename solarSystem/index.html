      Coming out of school I wanted to gain more experience in startups and business strategy.
      As their first employee I was initiated with caution. My responsibilites grew as we grew as a team and a company
      and as the cofounders familiarized themselves with my unique talents and capabilities to complement their own.
      Through my contribution in business planning, marketing, and salesmanship we started out producing in a Manhattan kitchen after hours
      to currently being housed in over 40+ local stores, 50+ nationwclasse, and significant revenue through our online sales platforms.

      <p>Programming had never been a part of my school curriculum despite going to an engineering school, I was introduced to the subject after my formal studies.
      Immediately enamored with everything about coding, I enlisted in General Assembly's Immersive course.
      There are many reasons why I chose this route but the most salient is that
      I am an entrepreneur so I want to build my own products which is what GA focuses on, doing not talking.
      Every day is an opportunity to delve further into your passions and GA exemplifies this with their interactive curriculum and exuberant teachers.

      Every week we studied a new technology and built an app surrounding it. My favorites were React and
      Ruby on Rails for how complex yet elegant they operate and the time they free up to finesse more interesting aspects of a project.
